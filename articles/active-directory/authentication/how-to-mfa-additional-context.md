# How to use additional context in multifactor authentication (MFA) notifications (Preview) - Authentication Methods Policy

This topic covers how to improve the security of user sign-in by adding application location based on IP address in Microsoft Authenticator push notifications.  

## Prerequisites

Your organization will need to enable Microsoft Authenticator push notifications for some users or groups using the new Authentication Methods Policy API.

>[!NOTE]
>Additional context can be targeted to only a single group, which can be dynamic or nested. On-premises synchronized security groups and cloud-only security groups are supported for the Authentication Method Policy.

## Passwordless phone sign-in and multifactor authentication 

When a user receives a Passwordless phone sign-in or MFA push notification in the Microsoft Authenticator app, they'll see the name of the application that requests the approval and the app location based on its IP address.

The additional context can be combined with [number matching](how-to-mfa-number-match.md) to further improve sign-in security.

### Policy schema changes

>[!NOTE]
>In Graph Explorer ensure you've consented to the **Policy.Read.All** and **Policy.ReadWrite.AuthenticationMethod** permissions. 

Identify a single target group for the schema configuration. Then use the following API endpoint to change the displayAppInformationRequiredState property to **enabled**:

https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/MicrosoftAuthenticator

>[!NOTE]
>For Passwordless phone sign-in, the Authenticator app does not retrieve policy information just in time for each sign-in request. Instead, the Authenticator app does a best effort retrieval of the policy once every 7 days. We understand this limitation is less than ideal and are working to optimize the behavior. In the meantime, if you want to force a policy update to test using additional context with Passwordless phone sign-in, you can remove and re-add the account in the Authenticator app. 

#### MicrosoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration properties

**PROPERTIES**

**RELATIONSHIPS**

| Relationship | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| includeTargets | [microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodTarget](/graph/api/resources/passwordlessmicrosoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethodtarget) |

|----------|------|-------------|
| authenticationMode | String | Possible values are:<br>**any**: Both passwordless phone sign-in and traditional second factor notifications are allowed.<br>**deviceBasedPush**: Only passwordless phone sign-in notifications are allowed.<br>**push**: Only traditional second factor push notifications are allowed. |
| id | String | Object ID of an Azure AD user or group. |
| targetType | authenticationMethodTargetType | Possible values are: **user**, **group**.<br>You can only set one group or user for additional context. |
| displayAppInformationRequiredState | advancedConfigState | Possible values are:<br>**enabled** explicitly enables the feature for the selected group.<br>**disabled** explicitly disables the feature for the selected group.<br>**default** allows Azure AD to manage whether the feature is enabled or not for the selected group. |

>[!NOTE]
>Additional context can only be enabled for a single group.

#### Example of how to enable additional context for all users

Change the **displayAppInformationRequiredState** from **default** to **enabled**. 

The value of Authentication Mode can be either **any** or **push**, depending on whether or not you also want to enable passwordless phone sign-in. In these examples, we'll use **any**, but if you do not want to allow passwordless, use **push**.

You need to PATCH the entire includeTarget to prevent overwriting any previous configuration. In that case, do a GET first, update only the relevant fields, and then PATCH. The following example only shows the update to the **displayAppInformationRequiredState**. 

```json
//Retrieve your existing policy via a GET. 
//Leverage the Response body to create the Request body section. Then update the Request body similar to the Request body as shown below.
//Change the Query to PATCH and Run query
 
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#authenticationMethodConfigurations/$entity",
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration",
    "id": "MicrosoftAuthenticator",
    "state": "enabled",
    "includeTargets@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations('MicrosoftAuthenticator')/microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration/includeTargets",
    "includeTargets": [
        {
            "targetType": "group",
            "id": "all_users",
            "authenticationMode": "any",
            "displayAppInformationRequiredState": "enabled",
            "numberMatchingRequiredState": "default"
        }
    ]
}
 
```
 
To confirm this update has applied, run the GET request below using the endpoint below.
GET - https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/MicrosoftAuthenticator
 
 
#### Example of how to enable additional context for a single group
 
Change the **displayAppInformationRequiredState** value from **default** to **enabled.** 
Change the **id** from **all_users** to the ObjectID of the group from the Azure AD portal.

>[!NOTE]
>If your organization is currently targeting **All users** for enablement of passwordless, and you enable number matching for a single group, the targeting will now be scoped only to that group for passwordless. You will want to ensure you have another group or groups appropriately scoped to passwordless enablement.

You need to PATCH the entire includeTarget to prevent overwriting any previous configuration. We recommend that you do a GET first, and then update only the relevant fields and then PATCH. The example below only shows the update to the **displayAppInformationRequiredState**. 

```json
//Copy paste the below in the Request body section as shown below.
//Leverage the Response body to create the Request body section. Then update the Request body similar to the Request body as shown below.
//Change query to PATCH and run query

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#authenticationMethodConfigurations/$entity",
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration",
    "id": "MicrosoftAuthenticator",
    "state": "enabled",
    "includeTargets@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations('MicrosoftAuthenticator')/microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration/includeTargets",
    "includeTargets": [
        {
            "targetType": "group",
            "id": "1ca44590-e896-4dbe-98ed-b140b1e7a53a",
            "authenticationMode": "any",
            "displayAppInformationRequiredState": "enabled",
            "numberMatchingRequiredState": "default"
        }
    ]
}
```
 
To verify, RUN GET again and verify the ObjectID
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/MicrosoftAuthenticator
 

#### Example of error when enabling additional context for multiple groups

The PATCH request will fail with 400 Bad Request and the error will contain the following message: 

`Persistance of policy failed with error: You cannot enable multiple targets for feature 'Require Display App Information'. Choose only one of the following includeTargets to enable: aede0efe-c1b4-40dc-8ae7-2c402f23e312,aede0efe-c1b4-40dc-8ae7-2c402f23e317.`

### Test the end-user experience
Add the test user account to the Microsoft Authenticator app. The account **doesn't** need to be enabled for phone sign-in. 

See the end-user experience of an Authenticator MFA push notification with additional context by signing into aka.ms/MFAsetup. 

### Turn off additional context

To turn off additional context, you'll need to PATCH remove **displayAppInformationRequiredState** from **enabled** to **disabled**/**default**.

```json
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#authenticationMethodConfigurations/$entity",
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration",
    "id": "MicrosoftAuthenticator",
    "state": "enabled",
    "includeTargets@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations('MicrosoftAuthenticator')/microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration/includeTargets",
    "includeTargets": [
        {
            "targetType": "group",
            "id": "all_users",
            "authenticationMode": "any",
            "displayAppInformationRequiredState": "default",
            "numberMatchingRequiredState": "default"
        }
    ]
}
```
